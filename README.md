Introduction
---------
1. Show that neural networks achieve the best performance on a handwriting recognition task (MNIST)
2. The optimal performance on MNIST was achieved using two essential practices. 
First, we created a new,general set of elastic distortions that vastly expanded the size of the training set. 
Second, we used convolutional neural networks.


`Affine:`
translations, rotations.....

`Elastic Distortation:`
distortion Image Using Gauss Distribution
